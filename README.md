# Doodly 

A fun little project I'm building while learning web development.  
This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp journey.

## What it does
Right now, it's a basic HTML file with ideas I plan to expand on.  
Stay tuned!

## Technologies
- HTML
- (More to come...)

## Goals
- Learn and practice front-end skills
- Add interactivity with JavaScript
- Maybe turn it into a drawing app!
